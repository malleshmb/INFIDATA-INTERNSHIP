GENERAL PROCEDURE

STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION
Collect data from various sources like online repositories, surveys, or use web scraping.

STEP 2: DATA CLEANING
Removing NaN Values
Removing Duplicate values
Removing anomalies

STEP 3: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Basic eda: .info, .describe, .shape, .size
Advanced eda
      #unvariate analysis: box plot, violin plot
      #bivariate analysis: pair plot

STEP 4: DATA PRE-PROCESSING
Data scaling : minmax scaling, standard scaling,  
label encoding :one hot encoding, mapping text to num
feature engineering 
      #modifying existing features
     #backward elimination
    #selection based on pearson coefficient

STEP 5: MODEL TRAINING
training the model on *train data*
obtain trained model

STEP 6: MODEL EVALUATION
evaluation the trained model on *test data*
obtain model evaluation parameters

STEP 7: MODEL INFERENCE
take new inputs from user
use the trained model to predict output for given set of inputs from user

STEP 8: GUI INTEGRATION(optional)
create a simple GUI using streamlit framework
deploy the trained model into created GUI.
